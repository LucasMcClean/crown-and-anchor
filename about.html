        <h2>About Crown & Anchor</h2>
        <p>
          Crown and Anchor is a traditional British gambling game that dates
          back to the 18th century. The game is typically played with six-sided
          dice and a special board marked with symbols representing various
          outcomes. Its origins can be traced to sailors and maritime culture,
          where it was often played aboard ships or in portside taverns.
          <br /><br />
          The game involves players placing bets on different symbols, such as
          crowns, anchors, hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs, which are
          depicted on the board. The dice are then rolled, and the outcome
          determines the winners and losers based on the symbols rolled.
          <br /><br />
          Crown and Anchor gained popularity not only among sailors but also in
          various social circles, becoming a common feature in fairs and
          festivals. It was widely played in the United Kingdom and its
          colonies, including Canada and Australia.
          <br /><br />
          Over the years, the popularity of Crown and Anchor has waned, but it
          still persists as a nostalgic and traditional game in some regions.
          While not as widespread as it once was, the game remains a part of
          British cultural history and serves as a reminder of the social and
          recreational activities enjoyed by communities in the past.

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Place Your Bets:</b> Place your bets on one or more of the symbols
          on the board. Each symbol represents a potential outcome of the dice
          roll. You can bet on as many symbols as you'd like. <br /><br />
          <b>Roll the Dice:</b> The three dice are rolled and the outcomes of
          the dice determine whether you win or lose your bet. <br /><br />
          <b>Determine Winnings:</b> You win if the symbols you bet on match any
          of the symbols rolled on the dice. The payout varies depending on the
          number of occurrences of the chosen symbol(s). If one die shows the
          chosen symbol, you'll receive even money (1:1); if two dice show the
          symbol, your payout is 2:1, and if all three dice show the symbol,
          your payout is 3:1. <br /><br />
          <b>Collect Winnings:</b> After the dice are rolled and the outcomes
          are determined, you'll collect your winnings if you bet on the winning
          symbols. Otherwise, you'll lose your bets.
